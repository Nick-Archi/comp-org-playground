## Overview 
Verilog based RISC-V CPU built from reading Computer Organization and Design RISC-V by Patterson and Hennessy<br>
I am implementing various computer elements from the Computer Organization And Design RISC-V Edition by Patterson and Hennessy.<br>
I intend to eventually create a fully functional RISC-V core.<br>

## Progress

- [x] Build basic combinational circuits (AND, OR, XOR, INV).<br>
- [x] Build basic ALU unit to perform basic operations.<br>
- [x] Expand ALU unit to perform operations in 32 bits.<br>
- [ ] Implement register files
- [ ] Implement control unit
- [ ] Modify ALU unit to work with sequential units

## Setup

I am using ModelSim 10.5b to test my RTL (Register Transfer Level) units.<br>
